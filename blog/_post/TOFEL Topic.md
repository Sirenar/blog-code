## Truths about Life

### Slow Down

Life can be hectic and stressful. We live in a world that is fast-paced and demanding. Constant emails, voice messages, breaking news, loud televisions, computer screens, and feeling over-scheduled is an all too familiar lifestyle for all of us.

#### As Residents

It can provide citizens/residents/people ways to unwind and loosen up/decompress/chill out.(facilitate people greater mental health.) Nowadays, (We’ve never lived in an age of such abundance of choices/With the overwork culture thriving), people are often occupied with lots of things like workload, school demands and responsibilities. (but never turning “off”). (We sometimes just can’t help but crave anything light-hearted—something that will take our mind away from the things happening right now.) So ... may allow them a brief(short-term) escape from life(the hustle and bustle), to regain energy(re-energize) and achieve higher efficiency and productivity in the workplace.

#### As Students

... can provide students ways to chill out. (facilitate students greater mental health.) Nowadays, With the intensity of peer competition rising, students are always occupied with sorts of things like quizzes, papers, presentations, community service or social events. (but never turning “off”). So ... may allows them a brief(short-term) escape from life, to regain energy and move onto their next assignment with higher efficiency and productivity.

#### As Employees

expectations have seemed to morph to the point that a 40-hour workweek is now the minimum expectation. 



::: tip EXAMPLE  Engrossed in a great book

Cracking open the pages of the most current novel I am reading, my heartbeat slows down and my body feel like mush; my mind blocks-out everything except for the characters, the plot, and the mystery of what is happening inside those word-filled paper pages.

### Interpersonal Relationship

#### Befriend the New

While taking part in...,  we’ll have more chance to socialize with like-minded individuals. It's easy to get caught in our comfort zone -- after all, it's comfortable there!(Meeting new students, making connections, and building relationships will all help down the line when we’re looking for a job.) By ... , we may meet people from far off but share at least a few of the same interests(values, perspectives) as ourselves), diversify our friendships(broaden social circles) and break free of this(build our networks), and thus, experience(open up) opportunities we would have missed out on otherwise. 



#### Sustain Relationships

Human beings are naturally social creatures. And when we consider that one-third of our lives is spend at work, it's (crystal) clear that good relationships with colleagues(fellows, co-workers) will make our jobs more cheerful(enjoyable). A strong network of people supporting us helps keep us from loneliness, decrease our stress, and helps us advanced social primates just chill out.

Also, building relationships is often the groundwork that must be laid before anything else gets done on a project. We need ...(to check in with our partners) to sharpen our empathy to understand the position of our partner, this helps us be there for each other when we need it the most rather than relying on fixing our issues alone. *When we hit roadblocks and aren’t sure we can proceed, the relationships around us provide strength and support.*

No need to say that the professional connections we make will also help to further our career(down the line when we're looking for a job/pave the way for fulfilling career).



#### True Friendship

A true friend goes beyond the surface, any true friendship requires some level of vulnerability. They are able to have difficult conversations in telling you things that sometimes you may not be eager to hear. The key is that they do it in love and with grace. They don't tear you down but rather a true friend will hold you to a standard they know your character is worthy of(encourage you to be a better version of yourself).

Although a true friend may encourage you to make good decisions, they trust your judgment and respect your own personal judgments. They don’t become passive aggressive when they give advice you don’t accept, instead, they respect boundaries and value your feelings and thoughts. They don’t push you to become who they want you to be, instead, they celebrate what makes you uniquely you. 

> A true friend is someone who has you back, no matter what. A real friend stays with you through traumas, disappointments, mental health crises, and physical maladies.



#### Set boundaries

It's imperative to practice saying no. Maybe you do not want to come across as mean or selfish(unkind), but saying no to one thing means saying yes to another. Setting personal boundaries is an equivalent of a front door to our hearts. We can open or shut this door whenever we need. Thus we'll be able to prioritize and focus on our own needs(for self-care).

Setting boundaries is the real secret in achieving a healthy life balance. Respectfully declining a task that may be too time-consuming(to attend something that would have taken time) could mean more sleep, an evening of Netflix, or quality time with families. 

* We all have limits in our relationships, and ignoring those limits can lead to feelings of resentment.
* Shift our relationships to become more honest, authentic, and free of resentment.
* Friendship can be strengthened or be broken by the words we utter from our mouths.



#### Handle Complaints

Remember that it takes effort to complain. Most unhappy customers won’t bother to complain—they’ll simply and quietly take their business elsewhere. A customer who takes the time to share(provide) their feedback, even if it is negative(we are not eager to hear), is giving us the opportunity to respond(for growth) and make things right. We can choose to see that as a gift. It provides valuable feedback that can ultimately help your business improve.



### Learning Approach

School is fast-paced, rigorous, and challenging. With each successive grade level, the content becomes increasingly more difficult and those who (are able to tap into their vocabulary bank) will have an easier time with all subjects.

#### Learn to Study

> Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school. — **Albert Einstein**.

The aim of education is not about the bunch(a collection) of data and information you hold in your head or the grades of your final examination, but about the learning habit, the intelligent way we think, the morals and ethics.  

* Always be in a state of curiosity. Be inquisitive.

#### Learn From Others

Learning is a two-way street. (Learning is a practice, not an event.) When we ... we're open to learning from others, and we benefit from their experience as well as our own and we can inherit their wisdom and knowledge. (Often we don't have to acquire all the knowledge on our own. (Collaboration and) sharing just make it twice as much.) 

when we discuss with peers, we develop and strengthen(refine/hone) interpersonal communication skills as well as analytical and critical thinking skills, because during the discussion we put forward an opinion through the process of reasoning, and support it by evidence. 

Nevertheless, When you argue(debate) with people who share different ideas(opposing views), you learn more not only about their perspective, but more about yourself as well. Once you are fully aware of your views and perspective, you will become more of an individual.



::: tips Homework

Colleges develop and hone soft skills through course requirements like essays, presentations, and group projects.

:::



#### Learn from Past

Our past is a treasure chest filled with learning opportunities for our present and future, but only if we look inside. Experience, also called empirical knowledge gives us the tools to analyze and explain problems in the past. 

**Provides perspective**. And It positions us to see patterns that might otherwise be invisible in the present, thus providing a crucial perspective for understanding and solving current and future problems. 

Rather than a dry collection of names and dates, the history tell us about the import intersection of time and place that defines who we are. (make sense of how it has grown and developed.)

As a result, it helps us become more impartial and thoughtful as decision-makers.

> "Those who cannot learn from history are bound(doomed/condemned) to repeat it."  — Spanish philosopher George Santayana
> Consider what happens when you meet someone for the first time. The conversation usually begins with a series of questions such as, “Where did you grow up?””How long have you lived here?”“Where did you go to school?” The importance of history in defining who we are cannot be overstated.



#### Learn from History

The past is a treasure chest filled with learning opportunities for our present and future, but only if we look inside. Through history, we can learn how past societies, systems, ideologies, governments, cultures and technologies were built, how they operated, and how they have changed(over time). 

And It positions us to see patterns that might otherwise be invisible in the present. 

All this knowledge makes them more rounded people who are better prepared to learn in all their academic subjects.



#### Early Work Experience

Even students who work in places not connected to their majors will look more impressive to potential employers. They'll have some kind of work experience on their resumes to start, and the fact that they've been able to hold (down) a job while attending school attests to their level of maturity, responsibility and time management. Employers look for employees who understand the work environment and work well as part of a team. Having a part-time job shows that the student is at least somewhat accustomed to the professional world, which will make the transition that much easier.



### Virtues

#### Brutal Honesty

In the long run, the honesty always outweighs any short term benefit.



#### Fairness



#### Obey the Rules

Even though some regulations in the workplace seem trite and insignificant, many protect the rights and safety of employees. Following rules and regulations help employees understand what is expected of them and what will happen if they violate the rules. It makes for an environment of predictability and consistency where people feel safe to come to work, to be themselves and to go about their business. The result is less turnover, more teamwork and higher company morale.

provide a sense of predictability and consistency



### Work-related Preferences

#### Do More with Less

There’s not a single person on the planet who wouldn’t like to make more money while working less at the same time.

Passion

Resonate with my persona, my dream, my aspiration. 

Turn their passions into profitable, scalable, sustainable businesses. 



#### Work in teams

When you’re part of a (study) group, you’re accountable to more than just yourself.  Your friends are depending on you to be there(show up) at the regularly scheduled meetings. This will increase(stimulate) your (internal/intrinsic) motivation(provide incentives) for studying and curb procrastination. 

*Group working* can make study more efficient and fun. "Two heads are better than one." / "None of us is as smart as all of us." Working with others enables you to pool your ideas and see problems from different perspectives. Groups have a greater well of resources to tap and more information available because of the variety of backgrounds and experiences. If you are working to a limited time frame, group work allows analysis to a greater(go further in) depth and breadth than if you were working individually.

#### Money vs Passion

Wealth can give the luxuries of life, but it cannot give mental peace and satisfaction.

Money is a very powerful thing. It builds empires and breaks down kingdoms; it allows for dreams to come true and it takes others away; it makes some people happy and others completely miserable. Today the pursuit of money is almost directly linked to the pursuit of happiness

#### Competitive

A strong and positive corporate culture can maintain high morale, empower workers to make decisions and develop a team spirit that fosters collaboration and innovation. The flip side to that is the detrimental effect that weak, negative corporate cultures have on the bottom line. It leads to a selfish atmosphere where the best employees flee and everyone looks out only for their own interests.



#### Blend work-life

New technologies such as e-mail and smartphones exacerbate this impatience and anxiety. E-mail etiquette often necessitates a response within 24 hours, with the general understanding that sooner is better. Managing this constant and mounting demand often involves switching tasks or multi-tasking, and the job never quite feels done…Multi-tasking is what makes us feel pressed for time.

If work is your life, then how do you disconnect? 

The idea that work begins and ends at the office is intuitively wrong. We laugh at silly clips of dog antics (animal pictures) on our work computers, and we answer emails on our couches in front of the TV. On the one hand, flexibility is nice. On the other, blending work and leisure creates an always-on expectation that makes it hard for white-collar workers to escape the shadow of work responsibilities.



### Regular Workouts

#### For Youth

Getting a regular workout/Engaging in a physical activity help me fall asleep and relieves/decreases insomnia(ensure better quality and consistent sleep), taking the high prevalence(incidence) of insomnia into consideration. 

Sleep is important. When you properly rest, your brain strenghthens the knowledge you have learned during the day by assimilating information so the better you sleep, the better you learn. (The correlation(connection/relationship) between sleeping and learning is often disregarded by some busy students but we should be aware(conscious) of the importance of this essential element of the learning process. )

Cardiovascular/Aerobic/Cardio exercises like walking, jogging, biking, burpees, sit ups enhance and increase our stamina and endurance level, burn off extra calories, and help us get trim and toned. All those achievements can add up to a boost of self-esteem—and the confidence that comes with it.



#### For Seniors

Seniors should opt for an active lifestyle instead of a sedentary one, but avoid overexerting one’s self. Getting a regular workout/Engaging in a physical activity help old adults fall asleep and relieves/decreases insomnia, taking the high prevalence(incidence) of insomnia into consideration. (Those who fall asleep faster, sleep longer, and have better quality sleep, will also have lower instances of depression, and report a general sense of well-being. )

Most cardiovascular/aerobic/cardio exercises like walking, jogging, dancing, yoga will do the trick, but seniors need to take some precautions with exercise because their bodies tend to be more fragile than younger people’s bodies. An injury while exercising could take longer to heal or cause complications for an elderly person. 



### Problem-solving Strategies

If you’re like me, you’ve got at least a few browser windows open (each one loaded with tabs you “*need*”). Your email inbox is steadily filling up in the background.

#### Avoid Multitasking

Do two things at once is to do neither./Two steps forward, one step back. We should engage our full attention to the task at hand. (This is an equivalent of hanging a "Do not disturb" sign in our minds.) Thus we'll be able to prioritize and achieve. 

This one-at-a-time approach is the real secret in achieving a healthy life balance. If we follow through to completion and reap the reward of accomplishments, we will experience a powerful feeling of being in control and successful.



#### See the big picture

Whether it’s your personal life or a work project, it’s easy to get bogged down and lost in the details. Being creative and letting your mind meander a bit



#### Time management

Deadlines hold us accountable to finish our work within the required(limited) timeframe. Failing to meet deadlines means failure to deliver on what you said you would. And it may cause trouble for others, since the person who assigns you the task probably has a subsequent deadline in mind. Moreover, there may be far more to that deadline than you can see from where you stand.

When working students have to measure out their time, they tend to be better planners as they make sure they complete every task expected of them on deadline. They learn to weigh their priorities, sometimes skipping fun activities to finish their responsibilities. 

This prepares them for life after school when excuses and tardy work will be frowned upon.



#### Unlock the Potential

Diamond in the rough.—diligence required to unleash the full potential of a person.

Albert Einstein was not considered intelligent, in fact, he’s equivalent to a high school drop-out!

Intelligence doesn’t guarantee success in our social life either,in fact being much more intelligent than others is more likely to make you an outcast rather tha mr.



#### Speak Up

> The courage to speak up for what is right is a virtue that the majority of us like to believe we possess. When push comes to shove, however, many people end up looking the other way.


#### Practice humility

Remember that there is a delicate balance between being speaking up in a way that's inclusive versus speaking up in a way that's overpowering. You refine your voice further by understanding the difference.

An inclusive voice shows both confidence and humility. Confidence doesn't mean that you hold your ground and aren't open to criticism. Nor does confidence mean that your idea is the best idea. It means that your arguments and logic are backed by supporting rationale, evidence, facts, and persuasive examples.

### Art

 Art has been an integral part of society since ancient times until today. However, the importance of art has deteriorated over the years. Subjects in schools including things like music, art, or drama have been pushed aside, and they are usually the first subject to go when it comes to budget cuts. Why is art important is a question many should ask themselves before dismissing the subject as immaterial and unnecessary.

#### Public Art

Public art reflects and reveals our society, adds meaning to our cities and uniqueness to our communities. 

Public art humanize the built environment and invigorates public spaces. Art can transform a gray and dull place into something vibrant and colorful, a place that attracts and becomes a talking point.

encourage civility

enable people to experience art in the course of daily life

#### Therapeutic



### Family Relationships

#### Intergenerational Relationships

The trend in recent decades is for older people to live alone. Even though people live healthier, longer lives, they expect to be self-sufficient. As a result of this desire for independence, either by nuclear families or older adults, only one in eight single elderly adults now lives with extended family. 



### Video Games
It keeps families closer

* One of the best benefits of playing video games is quality time with the family. 
* Gruesome and grisly video games, a culture that celebrates violence.



### Out-of-work Interests





### Be Patient

Waiting, even if we're forced to do it, actually teaches us the value of patience. When you don't get exactly what you want when you want it, you gain appreciation for the things you desire.

- Experiencing genuine happiness instead of immediate short term pleasure.

	  

### Modern Society

Today industrial societies consume most of the world’s resources, pollute its environment to an unprecedented degree, and have compiled nuclear arsenals that could undo thousands of years of human society in an instant.



We live in a society based on instant gratification. Hungry? A microwave will have you eating in minutes. Getting your dream car is a simple matter of signing up for debt. And months of pining for a perfumed reply from your true love is replaced by a simple click on send/receive. Life has become convenient, but are we better off for it?



## Society as a Whole

### Technology

(The way the world has changed in the past 50 years(five decades) has been absolutely staggering. )The force of technology permeates into almost every facet of 21st century life, from transport efficiency and safety, to access to food and healthcare, socialization and productivity. The power of the internet has enabled global communities to form and ideas and resources to be shared at nearly no cost.

While mankind has been able to build the impossible, there are more times than one when we have also created potential or even real catastrophes. (However, the overuse of some technology has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased [social division][1] and [privacy concerns][2].)

As beneficiaries of the greatest innovation(information) boom in the history of the world, ...

* Let you travel vicariously

* Fill the shoes of absent friends or family



#### Massification of knowledge

The internet seems to have the answer to virtually every question you could think of, as long as you type it into a search engine. 

The Internet permits access to mass knowledge and learning without any geographical limits and space barriers.

* More aware of the world around us.

::: details

Using digital tools and software for homework can help build familiarity with technology, which is no doubt a critical soft skill in today's society.

:::

::: tip EXAMPLE E-learning

The uppermost advantage of e-learning is flexibility in terms of time and place. Learning content is usually made available in short modules and can be paused at any time. Whether you log on while commuting, at work or during your free time- the learning material can be easily made part of your daily routine.

:::



#### Diminished Attention Span

The collective(average) attention span is diminished(shortened/narrowed), and the Internet is to blame. (It's a commonly known fact that the millennials have shorter attention spans due to the fact that they grew up in the Digital Age where overstimulation is the norm./A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.)A study found that the average adult can only stay on track for a total of eight seconds, shorter than a goldfish. 

The omnipresence of Internet gadgets in our lives drastically affect our ability to concentrate(by literally changing brain chemistry).This causes shallow information processing, and poor memory. 

* Juggle messages on their laptops from their email, instant messaging service and group messaging apps, all while checking their smartphones for social media updates and personal emails.
* What happens is that the student doesn’t effectively learn and retain the material.
* Most news programs only skim the surface of issues, and often offer a skewed or biased view of events. Programs are usually too short and too often interrupted by advertisements to delve very deeply into a topic. Instead of rich dialogues we get empty soundbites, slogans, and one-liners.

#### Spread of False Knowledge

In the internet age, false knowledge is spreading like wildfire. People consider themselves experts because they have easy access to information, but they never gain a deeper understanding of it.

#### Privacy concerns

While access to everything online gives us **an unparalleled level of convenience**, it has also made us vulnerable. Every move we make online is recorded, and we leave digital footprints wherever we visit. Hackers and scammers know this, and work hard to exploit it for financial gain.

::: details

Most children own a smartphone by the age of 10.

:::

#### Social Media

The media and its influential effect on the masses have increased exponentially in the past five decades, given how dependent we are on technology even for our basic requirements. 

##### Appearance anxiety

Social media uses stereotypes that can warp/skew/distort the watcher's perception of the world.

Airbrushed photographs of celebrities(or social media stars) with perfectly preened bodies are all over social media, but such flawless/unrealistic images have been described as damaging(and even destructive) for the way they pressurize young people to meet unobtainable body-image standards. 

Photoshopped images and the sharing(posting) of only the most flattering shots shifted young people’s understanding of what a normal body looked like. It's reported that a large percentage(62%) of teens felt that viewing media images had ramped up expectations over their personal appearance. Body dissatisfaction is linked to mental health challenges, including eating disorders, depression, and low self-esteem. 

Furthermore, celebrities minimize the severity of eating disorders (such as anorexia or bulimia), or endorse taking unhealthy products to suppress appetite, which can be deadly for those who suffer with life-threatening eating disorders. 

Social media use has also <u>contributed to a increasing sleep deprivation</u> among young people, which could be a symptom of mental illness.

“We’ve all been guilty of only posting our most flattering pictures on social media. While there’s nothing wrong with wanting to show yourself from your best angle, it’s important that we still like ourselves when we’re not looking our best, which is probably the majority of the time for most of us.” 

##### Role model

Whether celebrities are good or bad role models, they can influence your teen’s identity, values, attitudes, and behaviors. Celebrities that flaunt their status may influence young people to value superficial things like brand names and their image.

Violence, crime, and sex are frequently depicted on television and may have negative effects on impressionable children. Viewers sometimes imitate violent, criminal, sexual, or other risky behavior(like driving under the influence) they see on television, and end up in trouble, in jail, or in a hospital as a result.



#### Internet Addiction

For those who watch a lot, it's very hard to quit, so it is similar to a dependency like alcoholism or any another addiction. We should use the Internet properly rather than compulsively. 

##### Antisocial

Television makes us antisocial, taking the place of family and friends.



### Education

 “Education is the manifestation of perfection already existing in man.” As an integral part of modern society, education has a manifold impact, from improving health and livelihood(raising the quality of life), a more tolerant society, to creating conditions conducive to the development of talented individuals capable of changing the world. 

The most important priority of government as investor is indeed education, but education from cradle to grave. 

The first five years are particularly essential, as the brain development in those years determines how well children will be able to learn and process what they learn for the rest of their lives.

Even well-educated citizens, however, cannot <u>live up to their full potential</u> as creative thinkers and makers unless they ...

#### Solution of poverty

Like a tree, poverty has many roots. Among the many causes of global poverty, one factor stands out: education. Not every person without an education is living in extreme poverty, but most of those living in extreme poverty do lack a basic education. Access to high-quality primary education and supporting child well-being is globally-recognized solution to the cycle of poverty. A quality education system supports children developing social, emotional, cognitive and interpersonal communication skill 

##### Secure Better Jobs

While vocational training centers on hard skills, college primarily teaches soft skills, such as creativity, communication, and leadership. These skills tend to <u>stay relevant over time,</u> whereas hard skills risk becoming obsolete.

##### As a Human Right

Education is a human right that is indispensable for the exercise of other human rights. Education produces informed and capable citizens and empowers people to earn their way in the world.

##### Existing inequalities deepen

Although it can be argued that, in the long-run, investing in a child’s education will pay off eventually and will pave a path to high-paying jobs, poverty-stricken households simply cannot afford to lose a pair of working hands. Education is reserved for only those who can afford it. 

College isn't for everyone, but it should be available to anyone who wants to attend. A college education is useful both because of the skills it imparts and because of the signal that a degree can send to employers.

The high costs and low graduation rates of higher education make college a gamble, but it may be worth the risk if you generally like school and/or wish to pursue a career that requires a degree; otherwise, consider other postsecondary options, such as community college, vocational schools, and online programs — all of which can offer career training for substantially less money.



#### Educational Paradigm

##### Project-based

The main goal for schools and universities became not only to transfer to new generations earlier accumulated knowledge, but also to prepare them for the solution of problems which the personality and society have never met before. Increasing the time for independent and practical work of students which allows to be active at seminars and laboratories, to participate in discussions

It's gives you the opportunity to test what you have learn so far in your academic.
it's also gives opportunity to learn new thing which is out of syllabus.

##### Competence-based

Grades play a pivotal role in our current educational paradigm. Grades function as a simple and immediate feedback mechanism. 

There is a discrepancy between the one-dimensional character of grades and the multidimensional character of students. Einstein once said, “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” 

Practical use of knowledge

##### Grading System

They’re a convenient measurement tool that is easy to manage, store, and transmit. When dealing with masses of students, it is justifiable that these factors are decisive.



#### Teaching Strategy

##### Clear Regulations & Expectations

Professors can't make exceptions to policy. If they make an exception for student A, then students B and C come forward because they feel their circumstances warranted an exception too.

There are, and will be, many important situations in life that require you to be in a certain place at a certain time. /You fail to deliver on what you said you would. / You must make sure you complete the tasks expected of you on time(deadline). Punctuality and accountability are, quite arguably, even more essential in the workplace than in academia, where excuses and tardy work will be frowned upon.

##### Frequent & Successful Assessment



##### Student Engagement & Involvement

Students should be able to self-direct their learning as much as possible. This makes content more accessible and meaningful to them and stimulate their motivation. Provide students with multiple options whenever you can.



#### A Haven for Failure

We want students to be naive, to dream big, to take risks and to engage in divergent thinking. 



### Science

Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time. And for a brief moment, we have been among its passengers. Humans are driven to explore the unknown, discover new worlds, push the boundaries of our scientific and  technical limits, and then push further. 



### Environment

Where we live, eat, work, and play profoundly influences our health. (The conditions in and around our homes, schools, playgrounds, and workplaces can have a major impact on our wellness.)

Environmental pollutants can cause health problems like respiratory diseases(pulmonary disease), heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer. People in lower socioeconomic groups(with low incomes) are more likely to live in polluted areas and have unsafe drinking water. And children and pregnant women are at higher risk of health problems related to pollution.

* Factors such as pollution and litter can make residents less inclined to go outside for exercise and recreation, potentially making the entire community more prone to disease.

#### Global Warming

In this fast-paced world, people often use vehicles even for covering short distances.

##### Mitigation Strategies

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping(halting) or slowing (human-caused/human-induced/human-made) global warming, and each individual, business(company), municipal, state, and federal entity(government, institution, or other organization) must weigh their options in light of their own unique set of circumstances.

Where possible, we can switch to renewable sources of energy such as hydro energy, wind energy to power our homes and buildings, thus emitting far less heat-trapping(greenhouse) gases into the atmosphere.

Where feasible(practicable), we can drive electric vehicles(e-vehicles) instead of those(conventional ones) that burn(combust) fossil fuels; or we can use mass transit(take public transport) instead of driving our own cars.

Where affordable(practical), we can conserve energy by better insulating our homes and buildings(to retain heat), and by replacing old, failing appliances with more energy-efficient models(alternatives).

We can consider placing an upper limit on the amount of carbon dioxide we will allow ourselves to emit into the atmosphere within a given timeframe.

Stabilizing global temperature near its current level requires eliminating all emissions of heat-trapping gases or, equivalently, achieving a carbon-neutral society in which people remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as they emit. Achieving this goal will require substantial societal changes in energy technologies and infrastructure that go beyond the collective actions of individuals and households to reduce emissions.



#### Decrease biodiversity


### Economy

#### Why tax

To help fund public works and services—and to build and maintain the infrastructure used in a country

#### Tourism Industry

Tourism offers great opportunities for emerging economies and developing countries. It creates jobs, strengthens the local economy, contributes to local infrastructure development and can help to conserve the natural environment (biodiversity) and cultural assets and traditions, and to reduce poverty and inequality.


::: details

In 2019, tourism accounted for about ten per cent of global GDP (gross domestic product).

### Child-rearing

#### Lessons in Budgeting

Students earning their own money get lessons on spending wisely. They may be less likely to spend their hard-earned money frivolously(and excessively) and learn to delay gratification to pay for necessities, such as text books and rent. At the same time, they can save for non-essential purchases(items), such as a car.



No one is born old, your uptight, ancient, overprotective parents - were teens once too! 

Wisdom is knowledge applied judiciously. (Wisdom is the judicious application of knowledge.)

They aren’t influenced by the latest gossip on campus, nor by the hottest trend in the media you’re influenced by. Your parents have the ability to see the whole picture



Children need freedom — the freedom to explore, imagine, create, take things apart and put things together. 

Experiences like cooking from a recipe, organizing files or gardening are excellent tasks to assign to children to help them feel like they are performing an “adult” responsibility.

#### Chores

Many parents want to preserve childhood for as long as possible, letting the “kids be kids” and enjoy plenty of playtime while they’re still young. 

Children are our future. 

Deterioration of stable marriages and families has been a principal generator of moral decline. This is because children learn moral values mainly within their families, and mainly by relying on their parents as role models. 

In all of these ways, society today is turning away from the needs of children. Incredible though it may seem, because societal development has always implied a better future for our children, modern society is becoming ever more adult-centered. Adults have more freedom than ever, especially freedom for their own self-development and self-fulfillment, while children grow up in an ever more toxic environment.

The nature of the new toxic environment, of course, is different from the toxic environments of times past. Once children were beaten, now they are neglected; once they went hungry, now they are materially spoiled; once they lived in overcrowded conditions, now they sometimes live in virtual isolation. The most consequential change, particularly in recent decades, is a deterioration in the bond between parents and children. No longer can children count on what they need most--loving parents devoted to their wellbeing who act as good role models and protect them from harm.



Families today are under siege and children are being hurt. More and more children are growing up with weak attachments, little empathy, and a weakened respect for law and order and civility.



#### Pet

Children raised with pets show many benefits. Developing positive feelings about pets can contribute to a child's self-esteem and self-confidence. Positive relationships with pets can aid in the development of trusting relationships with others. A good relationship with a pet can also help in developing non-verbal communication, compassion, and empathy.





You cannot “judge a book by its cover” as they say. It is the persons personality, ethos that matters, not their choice of clothes.
