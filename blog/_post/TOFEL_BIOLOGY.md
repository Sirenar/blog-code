## Cell Theory

All living things are composed of cells. 

### Human Brain--Neuron

The neuron is a nerve cell and is the primary functional unit of the ==nervous system==.

#### Dendrites

The structures that look a little bit like tree branches are called dendrites. Dendrites are the area where neurons receive most of their information. There are receptors on dendrites that pick up signals from other neurons that come in form of chemicals called <u>neurotransmitters</u>. 

#### Soma

Those signals picked up by dendrites cause electrical changes in a neuron that are interpreted in an area called the soma or the cell body. The soma takes all the information from the dendrites and puts it together in an area called axon hillock. If the signal coming from the dendrites is strong enough, then a signal is sent to the next part of the neuron, which is called the axon. 

#### Axon

> Axon is covered with <u>insulated material</u> that helps to prevent the signal from degrading.

The signal travels down the axon. When the signal reaches the axon terminals, which are also known as `synaptic buttons` , it can cause the release of neurotransmitter. When a neurotransmitter is released from axon terminals, it interacts with receptors on the dendrites of the next neuron, and then the process repeats with the next neuron.

## Ecology

Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment.

### Population Ecology

| Term               | Meaning                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Population         | A group of individuals that belong in the <u>same species</u> and live in the <u>same area.</u>                                           |
| Population ecology | The ecological study of how biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors influence the density, dispersion, and size of a population. |

### Community Ecology

Community ecology looks at how bunches of living things interact with each other.

**Types of Interspecific Interaction**

| Type of interaction | General nature of Interaction                                                                 | Effection |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| Mutualism           | Both species benefit from interaction, such as bacteria in the gut that speed digestion.      | +/+       |
| Commensalism        | One species benefits without affecting the other, such as a spider spinning a web on a plant. | +/0       |
| Parasitism          | One species benefits, but the other is harmed, such as pathogenic microbes.                   | +/-       |
| Predation           | One species preys on the other for survival.                                                  | +/-       |
| Competition         | Two species fight over limited resources.                                                     | -/-       |

### Ecosystem Ecology

Ecosystem ecology is the study of the living and nonliving components within the environment, how these factors interact with each other, and how both natural and human-induced changes affect how they function. 

Ecosystem ecology looks at how ==energy and materials== come into an ecosystem, move around in it, and then get spat back out.

> Nutrients <u>cycling</u> through ecosystems depend on biological, geological, and chemical processes operating with the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, and make up Earth's ==biogeochemical cycles== .



#### Saprophytes

Saprophytes are organisms that live and feed on dead and decaying organisms. Fungi and a few bacteria are saprophytes.

Saprophytes undergo extracellular digestion to digest the dead and decaying matter. They have <u>tubular structures called hyphae</u> that branch into the dead matter and produce digestive enzymes to break down complex matter into simpler ones. The nutrients thus produced are absorbed directly through the cell membranes of the organisms.

> Saprophytes grow well in neutral or slightly acidic soil.



#### Biomes

We classify ecosystems into biomes, or habitats with similar characteristics.
