### Art

#### Therapeutic

Art is very important in the society because it is *an essential ingredient to empowering the hearts of people*



Since art is a form of self-expression, it can also help to encourage self-confidence and develop critical thinking.



As the[ The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/teen-blog/renaissance-portrait/blog/studying-art-from-the-past) puts it: “Looking at art from the past contributes to who we are as people. By looking at what has been done before, we gather knowledge and inspiration that contribute to how we speak, feel, and view the world around us.”



art can also have great indirect environmental benefits, by helping revitalize older, distressed neighborhoods. This, in turn, creates stronger cities and towns that are better positioned to absorb population and economic growth that might otherwise be diverted to sprawl. 



Whether it's painting, photography, music, dance, sculpture, performance or something else

arts, culture, and creative expression are important determinants of how communities fare

艺术、文化和创意表达是社区生活的重要决定因素

History gives us the opportunity to learn from others’ past mistakes. It helps us understand the many reasons why people may behave the way they do. As a result, it helps us become more impartial as decision-makers.




### Lifestyle

#### Physical Activities

Regular physical activity can relieve stress, anxiety, depression and anger. You know that "feel good sensation" you get after doing something physical? Think of it as a happy pill with no side effects! Most people notice they feel better over time as physical activity becomes a regular part of their lives.



Bosses(we) should (set aside some time to) check in with the employees outside work(when needed). This may take only a few minutes a week, but those few minutes can make the difference in helping (the team members/your friend /co-worker) remember the importance of the work you are doing together. If people don't have a chance to talk about important issues, misunderstandings can occur and tensions often build up.



**Progress is spearheaded by the brave and unconventional: It takes special type of person to pierce through the veil of darkness and ignorance of their time.** These are the innovators who created marvelous machinery and new technology, and the revolutionaries who shook things up and broke the mold of convention. When we look at the lives of luminaries such as Gandhi, Einstein, Mandela, Da Vinci, and Steve Jobs, We'll see that they followed unconventional paths and had beliefs that were considered radical by their contemporaries. 



We take technology for granted every day – even when it’s delivering us the latest news in an instant, making our cappuccino, or connecting us with a loved one halfway across the country (or even the world).





### Manners 

 facilitate more effective communication and increase engagement.

The more comfortable co-workers are around one other, the more confident they'll feel <u>voicing opinions(articulate ideas), brainstorming, and going along with new ideas.</u>



It's always better to build relationships *before* you need them or before a conflict arises.

the very nature of the relationship is reciprocal.



 Think of it as a happy pill with no side effects! 把它想象成没有副作用的快乐药丸！

Imbuing students with the knowledge they need to be functional adults in their day-to-day lives.



In many ways, having differences is a healthy part of relationships because it helps boost our individuality. 

在许多方面，有差异是人际关系中健康的一部分，因为它有助于增强我们的个性



Joining a student organization presents many opportunities to **learn more about yourself,** your goals, and your strength.



Instead of using our leisure time in restorative ways, we do things that continue to drain our energy. 



**Invest in yourself:** Take a risk and do something out of your comfort zone. It’s okay to fail. Its okay to take a chance. Start with small steps and build from there.

We learn when we read, what we hear, how we see, the way we discuss, and where we experience our lives.



So many accomplishments are abandoned at the cusp of greatness. 

如此多的成就在伟大的风口浪尖被抛弃。	



I actually believe there’s a great power in [brutal honesty](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/brutal-honesty/#truth1) — especially when it’s directed towards yourself. After all, how many of us have things our friends AREN’T telling us?



if you want to be saved by your prince charming on a horse, make sure first you are a princess worthy of saving too.如果你想被你的白马王子骑着马拯救，首先要确保你也是一个值得拯救的公主。

loneliness and social isolation are linked to higher risks for some health problems, including heart disease, depression and cognitive decline. 孤独和社会孤立与某些健康问题的高风险有关，包括心脏病、抑郁症和认知能力下降。

It's never too late to get a degree in university. Education opens your eyes to the world around you. 



Think of your knowledge in a specific domain as a tree. The fruit is what we see in front of us: it's the unearned knowledge that we can obtain, experience, and repeat right away. It's a very shallow understanding of the tree but it's not untrue. On the other hand, a first principles thinker will understand that body of knowledge from the fruit all the way down to the root. They will see that the apple is connected to a branch, and every branch is a subset of a greater whole called the trunk. Finally, they see that the root is the most fundamental part of the tree which gives rise to the fruit. 

果实就是我们眼前所见：这是我们可以立即获得、体验和重复的不劳而获的知识。 这是对树的非常肤浅的理解，但并非不真实。 另一方面，第一原理思想家会从果实到根部理解整个知识体系。 



#### soft skills

When someone applies for a job, there are certain hard skills they need to have like data analysis or bookkeeping. However, many employers also understand the very important need for[ soft skills](https://www.edgepointlearning.com/blog/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills/). These **intangible attributes** are hard to measure and often difficult to define. Some examples include a person’s ability to adapt to change, think creatively, or collaborate with team members.



in-person communication allows for this type of interaction, as well as the ability to read body language and other physical reactions.



While access to everything online gives us **an unparalleled level of convenience**, it has also made us vulnerable. Every move we make online is recorded, and we leave digital footprints wherever we visit. [Hackers and scammers](https://tech.co/tag/privacy-security) know this, and work hard to exploit it for financial gain.



## Use cases



Even with the rise of technology, many businesses continue to opt for face-to-face meetings because they can facilitate more effective communication, help build strong relationships and increase engagement.



Friendship is free. There is no cost to sharing a laugh, having someone to talk about your day or [walk](https://fave.co/39SaQB6) around town with. Being with friends offers a great time and good memories, both of which **don’t cost you a dime.**



Being able to see the big picture is important in many areas of life. Whether it’s your personal life or a work project, it’s easy to get bogged down and lost in the details. Being creative and letting your mind meander a bit is like taking a walk in the forest. Rather than stopping to focus on one piece of moss, keep wandering down the path and open up the forest. You’re able to see past the trees, in a way.

能够看到大局在生活的许多领域都很重要。无论是您的个人生活还是工作项目，很容易陷入困境并迷失在细节中。



**Improves Decisions.** Everyone makes decisions every day. In our workplace roles, we often encounter important decisions that condition business results. <u>When the culture and atmosphere is more polite and courteous it keeps people from being hung up on non-productive issues which dramatically improves the decision making process.</u>

当文化和氛围更加礼貌和礼貌时，它可以防止人们被非生产性问题所困扰，从而显着改善决策过程。



good manners can help strengthen your existing relationships and create new friendships—it's known as the "find-remind-and-bind" theory of gratitude.

Are you always late and come up with a million excuses as to why?



Do you ask for help when you don’t know how to do something or can’t manage it on your own? Since when did asking for help at work become a bad thing? Perhaps you think asking for help is a sign of weakness; that if you ask for help you’re admitting you’re inadequate in some way; that you lack knowledge, skill or experience to do something yourself. You don’t want anyone to see that you’re struggling; you want people to think that you’re in control and can handle things. You may not want to come across as annoying or unintelligent, but speaking up is likely to have the opposite effect. It’s OK to ask for help. Actually, it’s encouraged.

### Are we obligated to know history?

Without history, a society shares no common memory of where it has been, what its core values are, or what decisions of the past account for present circumstances. Without history, we cannot undertake any sensible inquiry into the political, social, or moral issues in society.





**bedroom distractions**: Televisions, cellphones, and bright lights can make it more challenging to fall asleep. Keep the television in another room and try not to fall asleep with it turned on. Move electronics out of the bedroom and reserve the bedroom for only sleeping and sex.





## Why physics is a basic science?

Age appropriate, weekly chores, whether it’s taking out the garbage, emptying the dishwasher, folding clean laundry, cleaning the cat litter box, or light yard work like raking leaves, can help a child develop character. 



On issue of concern turning into an obsession for a plethora of parents is the difficulties and importance of taking care of young children. It is crystal clear that a blame can brings about some terrible consequences. Different people have distinct perspectives in regard to whether or not older children should be responsible to take care of younger kids. Although it is a little cumbersome to reach a consensus on this issue, a large percentage of parents prefer do the task by themselves. Conversely, I, to a great extent, disagree with the point of view which children should not allow to take of younger ones. My reasons are manifold, among which the most significant ones are substantiated in the following paragraphs.

**To commence with**, the first exquisite point to be mentioned is that many activities which children do in their childhood is a proportion of their train. As a matter of fact, when they take the responsibility of others, they are preparing for the future since they will have to shoulder the responsibility of numerous tasks. Actually, they find that some of the responsibilities are really influential, and they cannot put the blame on others According to a noteworthy statistics of a research, conducted at the University of Tehran, the children who have to be responsible for numerous activities will be more prosperous in the future. The results show 8 out of 10 people who had to look after their young siblings were more successful when they got older.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, almost all individuals have to take care of their children some day. Therefore, they should learn this skill as well as other momentous activities during their childhood. Although numerous adults think that it may cause several terrible happenings, others completely disagree .In other words, when they are younger, they have the opportunity to do it while their parents control it. Hence, they may less likely do something wrong, and consequently, they will be prepared in the future. For instance, they learn how to feed babies based on their characteristics.

Last but not least, taking care of children is a tough responsibility which is often done by parents. Unfortunately, many children turn a blind eyes to the kindness of parents. As a result, children should look after younger kids to understand how difficult it is. I may contribute to forming a more respectful son or daughter, on the grounds that they realize during their different stages of life who sacrifices his/her life to have better living.

To sum up, considering the aforementioned arguments, we may draw the conclusion that children should have the chance to take the responsibility of younger siblings. Not only does it increase their information and knowledge, but it also helps them to become more responsible towards their works and acts. Moreover, if children experience such arduous activities like their parents, they conceive and respect their parents more.
